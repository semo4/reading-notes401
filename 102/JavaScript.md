# Hello World using Javascript
- Just to give you a little excitement about Javascript programming, I'm going to give you a small conventional Javascript Hello World program.

```
<html>
   <body>   
      <script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript">
         <!--
            document.write("Hello World!")
         //-->
      </script>      
   </body>
</html>

```

It is really impossible to give a complete list of all the available Javascript frameworks and libraries. The Javascript world is just too large and too much new is happening.


# Applications of Javascript Programming
1. Client side validation

2. Manipulating HTML Pages 

3. User Notifications 

4. Back-end Data Loading 

5. Presentations 

6. Server Applications 


## JavaScript Datatypes
- One of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of data types it supports. These are the type of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language.

-JavaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types −

 1. Numbers, eg. 123, 120.50 etc.

 2. Strings of text e.g. "This text string" etc.

 3. Boolean e.g. true or false.


### variable initialization

```
<script type = "text/javascript">
   <!--
      var name = "Ali";
      var money;
      money = 2000.50;
   //-->
</script>

```
