## What is a Linked List
- A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.
- Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array

- Linked list can be visualized as a chain of nodes, where every node points to the next node.

## Types of Linked List
- Following are the various types of linked list.

    - Simple Linked List − Item navigation is forward only.

    - Doubly Linked List − Items can be navigated forward and backward.

    - Circular Linked List − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.


## Basic Operations
- Following are the basic operations supported by a list.

    - Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.

    - Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.

    - Display − Displays the complete list.

    - Search − Searches an element using the given key.

    - Delete − Deletes an element using the given key.


### Insertion Operation
- Adding a new node in linked list is a more than one step activity. We shall learn this with diagrams here. First, create a node using the same structure and find the location where it has to be inserted.

### Deletion Operation
- Deletion is also a more than one step process. We shall learn with pictorial representation. First, locate the target node to be removed, by using searching algorithms.

### Reverse Operation
- This operation is a thorough one. We need to make the last node to be pointed by the head node and reverse the whole linked list.
