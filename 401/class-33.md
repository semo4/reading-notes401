- GraphQL is an open source server-side technology which was developed by Facebook to optimize RESTful API calls.
- It is an execution engine and a data query language

### fundamental concepts of GraphQL
1. Implement GraphQL API using Apollo server

2. Test GraphQL API using GraphiQL

3. Build ReactJS (with Apollo Client library) and jQuery client applications to consume the API

- we use GraphQL because it has RESTful APIs follow clear and well-structured resource-oriented approach.

### advantages of using GraphQL query Language
1. Send a GraphQL query to your API and get exactly what you need
2. Get many resources in a single request
3. Describe what’s possible with a type system
4. Move faster with powerful developer tools

- for  the environmental setup for GraphQL you can visit [GraphQL @connection](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql-transformer/connection)

### GraphQL Server can be deployed by using any of the three methods listed below −

1. GraphQL server with connected database
2. GraphQL server that integrates existing systems
3. Hybrid approach

#### GraphQL Server with Connected Database
- This architecture has a GraphQL Server with an integrated database and can often be used with new projects.

- This approach is helpful for companies which have legacy infrastructure and different APIs

#### Hybrid Approach

- Finally, we can combine the above two approaches and build a GraphQL server
