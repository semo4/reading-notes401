# Intro to JavaScript
- we use JavaScript to make web pages more interactive
- JavaScript give us the control to access and modify the content of web page.
    1. Access content:
     - we can select any element , attribute or text from Html page
    2. modify content:
     - we can add, element, attribute or text to the page 
- in JavaScript there is some rules to follow:
    1. Program Rule:
     - we can spicify set of step the brwoser to follow:
        1. like image we can make it clickable to display it in larger form 
        2. Calculater to calculate nu,ber and display the result
        3. An Animation to web page
- JavaScript also give us the power to make web page interact with user.
   1. we can spicify a script that will run when specific event has occured.
    - botton pressed.
    - link clicked
    - Cureser hobers over element

## Summeary
- JavaScript give us the ability to :
1. Access the content of the page
2. Modify the content of the page
3. Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
4. React to events triggered by the user or browser


# Expressions + Operators

 ## RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES
 1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
 2. You cannot use keywords or reserved words.
    - Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something.
 3. All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables
      that have the samename using different cases.
 4. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.

### JavaScript has the following types of operators.
1. Assignment operators
    - An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator   is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.
2. Comparison operators
    - A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.
3. Arithmetic operators
    - An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. The standard arithmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). 
4. Logical operators
    - Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value
5. String operators
    - In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.
6. Conditional (ternary) operator
    - The conditional operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. The operator can have one of two values based on a condition 
    - Example :var status = (age >= 18) ? 'adult' : 'minor';
7. Comma operator
    - The comma operator (,) simply evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand. This operator is primarily used inside a for loop, to allow multiple variables to be updated each time through the loop. It is regarded bad style to use it elsewhere, when it is not necessary. Often two separate statements can and should be used instead.

8. Relational operators
    - A relational operator compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on whether the comparison is true.


# Functions



- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
