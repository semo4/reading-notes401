- Tree represents the nodes connected by edges.

## Important Terms

- **Path** − Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.

- **Root** − The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.

- **Parent** − Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.

- **Child** − The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.

- **Leaf** − The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.

- **Subtree** − Subtree represents the descendants of a node.

- **Visiting** − Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.

- **Traversing** − Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.

- **Levels** − Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.

- **keys** − Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.

# Binary Search Tree Representation

- Binary Search tree exhibits a special behavior. A node's left child must have a value less than its parent's value and the node's right child must have a value greater than its parent value.

## BST Basic Operations

- **Insert** − Inserts an element in a tree/create a tree.

- **Search** − Searches an element in a tree.

- **Preorder Traversal** − Traverses a tree in a pre-order manner.

- **Inorder Traversal** − Traverses a tree in an in-order manner.

- **Postorder Traversal** − Traverses a tree in a post-order manner.
