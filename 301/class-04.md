# CSS Grid

- CSS Grid is a powerful tool that allows for two-dimensional layouts to be created on the web. This guide was created as a resource to help you better understand and learn Grid, and was organized in a way I thought made the most sense when learning it.

### Type of Grid:
1. **Grid Container**
    - Create a grid container by setting the display property with a value of grid or inline-grid. All direct children of grid containers become grid items.
2. **Explicit Grid**
    - Explicitly set a grid by creating columns and rows with the grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties.

3. **Minimum and Maximum Grid Track Sizes**
    - Tracks sizes can be defined to have a minimum and/or maximum size with the minmax() function.
4. **Repeating Grid Tracks**
    - Define repeating grid tracks using the repeat() notation. This is useful for grids with items with equal sizes or many items.
