- A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links.
- a graph is a pair of sets (V, E), where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges

### Important terms
- Vertex − Each node of the graph is represented as a vertex.
- Edge − Edge represents a path between two vertices or a line between two vertices
- Adjacency − Two node or vertices are adjacent if they are connected to each other through an edge.
- Path − Path represents a sequence of edges between the two vertices.

### Basic Operations
- basic primary operations of a Graph 
    1. Add Vertex − Adds a vertex to the graph.
    2. Add Edge − Adds an edge between the two vertices of the graph.
    3. Display Vertex − Displays a vertex of the graph.

### Type Of Graph
- 1. Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm
- 2. Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm
