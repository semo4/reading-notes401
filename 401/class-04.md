# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

## Objects
- Real-world objects share two characteristics − They all have state and behavior.
- An object stores its information in attributes and discloses its behavior through methods.

## Class
- A class is a group of objects that have mutual methods. It can be considered as the blueprint using which objects are created.
- Classes being passive do not communicate with each other but are used to instantiate objects that interact with each other.

## Interface
- The point where the software entities interact with each other either in a single computer or in a network is known as a public interface.

## Inheritance
- Inheritance as in general terms is the process of acquiring properties. In OOP one object inherits the properties of another object.

- A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.

- A class can contain any of the following variable types.

    - **Local variables** − Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables. The variable will be declared and initialized within the method and the variable will be destroyed when the method has completed.

    - **Instance variables** − Instance variables are variables within a class but outside any method. These variables are initialized when the class is instantiated. Instance variables can be accessed from inside any method, constructor or blocks of that particular class.

    - **Class variables** − Class variables are variables declared within a class, outside any method, with the static keyword.

- A class can have any number of methods to access the value of various kinds of methods.

### Constructors
- Every class has a constructor. 
- If we do not explicitly write a constructor for a class, the Java compiler builds a default constructor for that class.
- Each time a new object is created, at least one constructor will be invoked


# Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

## Decimals
- Every digit in a decimal number has a "position"
- Every position further to the left is 10 times bigger, and every position further to the right is 10 times smaller

## Bases
- The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10
- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9

## Binary Numbers
- are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits ... so you start back at 0 again, but increase the number on the left by 1.

## Hexadecimal Numbers
- They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.

- 
- Decimal:	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12	13	14	15
- Hexadecimal:	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	A	B	C	D	E	F
